Neural Network deep learning projects for solving underdetermined problems on converting strong corelated quantum many-body problems, perturbative, to analytic single-body black brane in d+2 spacetime AdS spacetime.
The theoretical base is the Holography, AdS/CFT correspondence, that means d+2 AdS spacetime supergravity physics include d flat space QFTs. The underdetermined parameters appear if the direction is from QFT to AdS supergravity.
The 1st code didn't be commited was linux-only codes by the handling multiprocessings of pytorch library: spawn only on Windows. 2nd, this branch, is incomplete in full tasks' view. The actual date of this codes is 2025.01.09.
